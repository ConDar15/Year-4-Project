\label{SUB_"Division and Multiplication"}
\subsection{Introduction}
Though the idea of Division and Multiplication can seem fairly simple, particularly from an abstract pure mathematical point of view, these calculations can be computationally difficult. This section will show a few algorithms designed to calculated these values, and discuss their implementation and efficiency.
